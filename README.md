## Documentation for COVID-19 testing data in Italy

Read the [report](https://pitmonticone.github.io/covid-italy/owid-testing-italy.html) co-authored by [Pietro Monticone](https://github.com/pitmonticone) and [Riccardo Valperga](https://github.com/Ricvalp). 

## Aggregator of COVID-19 references for Italy

Explore the [dashboard](https://pitmonticone.github.io/covid-italy/dashboard.html) created by [Pietro Monticone](https://github.com/pitmonticone) and [Riccardo Valperga](https://github.com/Ricvalp) in collaboration with [Francesco Furno](https://github.com/FFurno) and [Paolo Beria](https://github.com/beriapaolo).

## A simple SIR model 

* [Julia script](https://github.com/pitmonticone/covid-italy/blob/master/models/sir.jl)
* [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/pitmonticone/covid-italy/blob/master/models/sir.ipynb)

## Estimating *R_t* in Real-Time

The following notebooks by [Michele Tizzoni](https://github.com/micheletizzoni) reproduce the estimate of the time-varying reproductive number for Italy:

* [National level](https://github.com/micheletizzoni/covid-19/blob/master/Realtime%20R%20-%20Italy.ipynb)
* [Subnational level](https://github.com/micheletizzoni/covid-19/blob/master/Realtime%20R%20-%20Italian%20Regions.ipynb)

**NB**: The method is based on some strong assumptions. However, the results are pretty much in line with those, more statistically solid, reported by Sam Abbott [here](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid).
